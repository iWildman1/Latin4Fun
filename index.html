                <h3>Why learn latin?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many reasons you might wish to learn Latin.  Here are a just a few of them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to keep one’s brain active</li>
                    <li>to help learn grammar</li>
                    <li>it underpins romance languages which are descended from Latin and therefore it is easier to learn them if you already know Latin</li>
                    <li>to meet like-minded people </li>
                    <li>to accompany other studies and areas of interest, particularly classical, ecclesiastical or mediaeval history</li>
                    <li>to make learning scientific names of living organisms easier, particularly for gardeners and botanists</li>
                    <li>the words of much choral music are in Latin, and learning the language would be an aid to understanding</li>
                    <li>for those interested in churches it is useful for reading inscriptions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All of these are perfectly valid reasons for learning Latin but  I have to agree with the renowned classics scholar Mary Beard when she says in her book Confronting the Classics that:
                </p>
                <p class="italic accent-red serif">
                    There is really only one good reason for learning Latin, and that is that you want to read what is written in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if you would like to read Virgil’s Aneid or Ovid’s love poetry or Tacitus’ history of Britain or the rhetoric of Cicero in all their original glory, then my classes might be for you.

                        <h3>You Already Know Latin</h3>
                        <p>
                            It might surprise you how much Latin you already know and use, possibly without even realizing it.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many, many more and it can be an interesting diversion to see how many you can find.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The truth is, the more you study Latin, the more you realise just how many words in English are derived from Latin, although many have come via (there’s another Latin loan!) Norman French due to the Conquest.

                        <h3>What and How I Teach</h3>
                        <p>
                            I generally tutor individuals or small groups at my home office. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am rather old school in that I like to teach a really thorough grounding of grammar.  However, the emphasis is always on reading Latin, lots and lots of reading Latin! 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And hopefully it is lots of fun as well although it may be challenging at times.  I always tailor my teaching to suit my learners’ needs and wishes so that you only go as far and as fast as you wish to go.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I base my teaching on the Cambridge Latin Course books which are widely used in schools but I have found them to be just as enjoyable for adults to use and they are based on reading.

                        <p>
                            I have always had a great passion for the classics of the ancient world as well as languages in general. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been studying and reading Latin for over 30 years at school and University where I did my M.A. dissertation on the Carmina Burana, a collection of poems in mediaeval Latin and German.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have a level 3 Certificate in Education and Training and started teaching about a year ago.  
                        </p>
                        <h3>Costs</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sessions for individuals are £25 per session (1 hour) but there are reductions for groups and some concessions are available.
                        </p>

                            If you are interested in Latin and want to have a bash at it yourself, there are two books available that I would recommend for adult readers that you might like to look at.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both books are good introductions to give you a taste of the language and some Roman history and culture, but there is very little reading practice in them.  If you’ve read these and want to learn more and read more actual Latin then call me for a chat and sign up for a taster session.
