                <h3>Why learn latin?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many reasons you might wish to learn Latin.  Here are a just a few of them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to keep one’s brain active</li>
                    <li>to help learn grammar</li>
                    <li>it underpins romance languages which are descended from Latin and therefore it is easier to learn them if you already know Latin</li>
                    <li>to meet like-minded people </li>
                    <li>to accompany other studies and areas of interest, particularly classical, ecclesiastical or mediaeval history</li>
                    <li>to make learning scientific names of living organisms easier, particularly for gardeners and botanists</li>
                    <li>the words of much choral music are in Latin, and learning the language would be an aid to understanding</li>
                    <li>for those interested in churches it is useful for reading inscriptions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All of these are perfectly valid reasons for learning Latin but  I have to agree with the renowned classics scholar Mary Beard when she says in her book Confronting the Classics that:
                </p>
                <p class="italic accent-red serif">
                    There is really only one good reason for learning Latin, and that is that you want to read what is written in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if you would like to read Virgil’s Aneid or Ovid’s love poetry or Tacitus’ history of Britain or the rhetoric of Cicero in all their original glory, then my classes might be for you.

                        <h3>You Already Know Latin</h3>
                        <p>
                            It might surprise you how much Latin you already know and use, possibly without even realizing it.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many, many more and it can be an interesting diversion to see how many you can find.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The truth is, the more you study Latin, the more you realise just how many words in English are derived from Latin, although many have come via (there’s another Latin loan!) Norman French due to the Conquest.
